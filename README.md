# Word practice

As a mother on parental leave I go to SFI Swedish language class designed for parents with small children.
There are babies between few weeks to one year old. As a part of the class we learn a lot of new words.
I would like to practice these words. Optionally on my phone.
This is the first version which I use on daily bases.

## Input

* You need to create a csv file in the **Exercises** folder OR
* change the dictionary folder in the WordPractice.conf file.
* The header (the first line) should contain the to/from languages.
* In my case: "Swedish,English". 

There is an example file in the Excercises folder.

Start the program and follow the questions. You can choose:
* Number of times you want to practice a random word
* Which language do you want to translate from?

## Next steps
* Refactor the code (OOP, define functions)
* Add unit tests
* Save results for statistics / practice words with higher chance that wrong during multiple tries
* Follow improvements (notice words you start to get right)
