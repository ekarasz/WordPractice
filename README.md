# Word practice

As a mother on parental leave I go to SFI Swedish language class designed for parents with small children.
There are babies between few weeks to one year old. As a part of the class we learn a lot of new words.
I would like to practice these words. Optionally on my phone.
This is the first version which I use on daily bases.

## Input

* You need to create a csv file in the **Exercises** folder OR
* change the dictionary folder in the WordPractice.conf file.
* The header (the first line) should contain the to/from languages.
* In my case: "Swedish,English". This will translate from Swedish to English

## Next steps

* Add Google Drive files as an option (This is where I save the files)
* Add unit tests
* Save results for statistics / practice words with higher chance that wrong during multiple tries
* Follow improvements (notice words you start to get right)
